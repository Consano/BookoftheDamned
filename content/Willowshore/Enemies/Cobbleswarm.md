### Description
> Cobble mites look like stones or rocks with small mouths that resemble the inside of geodes. Tiny, unassuming, and typically harmless, they reside in mountains and cavernous regions, subsisting on scraps of food and gravel. When dozens of cobble mites congregate, they use their collective might to overwhelm and consume small creatures, much like a school of hungry piranhas attacking and devouring unfortunate animals.
