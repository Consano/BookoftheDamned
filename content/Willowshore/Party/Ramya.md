Notes: 
<br>Unpredictable, dangerously so. Seems she has formed an attachment to me. 
<br><br>Assessment: 
<br>Ramya is a double-edged sword. Her abilities make her a potent ally however the explosiveness of her emotional state could lead to 'unfortunate' circumstances. Not to mention that her position within our group jeopardizes my position with Granny Hu (it should be noted that this trait is not unique to her). Ugly Cute's blessing means that it will be hard to shake her if it ever comes to that.<br><br>While her "liking" for me might be genuine like she claims, it warrants caution. She is dangerousâ€”not necessarily in malice, but in her propensity to act without full consideration of the consequences. <br><br>Overall, her usefulness outweighs her flaws for the time being. Especially with her willingness to teach me magic. It would be wise to keep an eye on her though.</span>
