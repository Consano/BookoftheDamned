Notes: 
<br>The newest member to our little group, strangely absent during the original attack. Bested me in combat with help of Korakai. Investigation into the origin of his strength is critical and should be considered top priority.
<br><br>Assessment: 
<br>Galdan uses a unique fighting style that I'm unfamiliar with. This makes him dangerous as it's hard for me to gauge the full extent of his capabilities. From my current understanding, I believe I could overtake him in a one-on-one duel. He claims his skills come from laboring on the town farms, something that simply is not true. Frustratingly, his closed-off nature makes it difficult to reveal any tangible answers about his past.<br><br>What I do know however is that his position in the group creates a tie between the Northridge and Southbank supporters. It was his <u>direct</u> influence that kept Matsuki in power. He'll learn to regret that.</span>
