<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Handwriting'; font-optical-sizing: auto; font-style: normal; word-break: break-word;"><br><br>**Subject: Korakai**<br>Full Name: Korakai (surname unknown)<br>Species: Tengu<br>Occupation: Unknown<br><br>Relationships:
<br><span>&bull;</span> Quite favored by Old Matsuki, perhaps old friends
<br><br>
Conditions:
<br><span>&bull;</span> Unknown
<br><br>
Capabilities:
<br><span>&bull;</span> Divine magician, power originates from Hei Fang
<br><span>&bull;</span> Affinity for storm-based magic
<br><span>&bull;</span> Skilled diplomat, even better than myself
<br><span>&bull;</span> Strong knowledge of tea making
<br><br>
Weaknesses:
<br><span>&bull;</span> Trusting, likely easy to manipulate
<br><span>&bull;</span> Connection to Hei Fang & Matsuki
<br><span>&bull;</span> Physically frail
<br><br>
Notes: 
<br>Bested me in combat with the help of Galdan. Quite an annoying foe. Further study required into his private life.
<br><br>Assessment: 
<br>Korakai is a frustratingly capable opponent both in a fight and the social climate. His favor with Matsuki puts him at odds with my goals. With his current position as the 'face' of our group, it will be nigh impossible to further my agenda through town politics.<br><br>The best course of action would be to stoke the flames of Granny Hu's followers using subterfuge. Confrontation may be inevitable.</span>
