<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Handwriting'; font-optical-sizing: auto; font-style: normal; word-break: break-word;"><br><br>**Subject: Ataxa**<br>Full Name: Ataxa<br>Species: Tsukumogami<br>Occupation: Alchemist (?)<br><br>Relationships:

Notes: 
<br>Further study required. The information here is pitiful at best, a failure on my part. 
<br><br>Assessment: 
<br>Ataxa is a strange one, in all my travels I have never met someone so... perplexing. Based on ~~it's~~ their(?) demeanor to those who oppose our group, they may be an example of tsukumogami who are born of mistreated tools. It would be unwise of me to rouse their hatred as I'm not entirely confident in my ability to resist their hexes despite their physical size.<br><br>Overall, their presence is the least of my worries. At the very least they do not compromise my plans with Granny Hu. Efforts should be made to confirm this fact (and many others) however. As usual, Ugly Cute's blessing will make it hard to sever ties until the fog is lifted.</span>
