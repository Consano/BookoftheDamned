### Description
> [!info] Originally a stone statue protecting the town of [[Willowshore]], alongside a magical lantern. Disappeared at the start of the Season of Ghosts and was later found by the party battling 3 [[Cobbleswarm]]s. This rendered it immobile for the foreseeable future and so it entrusted the task of protecting [[Willowshore]] to the party.
### Quests
- [x] Protect [[Willowshore]]
- [x] Check out the lumberyard
### Other Notes
- Gave part of his carapace in the form of a gauntlet to [[Galdan]]
