This silk rope measures 50 feet long and is capable of holding up to 3,000 pounds. If the rope is ever cut, only the longest remaining portion retains its magic.  

**Activate** `[one-action]` Interact; **Frequency** once per day; **Effect** You hold one end of the rope and point to a destination. The rope animates for 1 minute, moving 10 feet per round until it reaches the destination or runs out of length. The rope can move across any non-damaging horizontal or vertical surface, but it can't extend upward without a surface to support it. At any point while the rope is animated, you can use an Interact action to wiggle the rope, giving it one of the following commands: stop in place, fasten securely to the nearest available object, detach from an object, or knot or unknot itself.
